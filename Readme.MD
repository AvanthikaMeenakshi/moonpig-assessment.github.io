1. Move error component to its own file, improve error handling
2. Lazy loading components so they load only when route is requested
3. Have a separate config for prod and dev - webpack
4. Implement size picker on card view page
5. Implement pre-commit hooks to test linting and test cases before commit
6. Improve test coverage, see if we can refactor test cases
